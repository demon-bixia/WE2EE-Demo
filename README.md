## Run in development mode

These are the steps you need to take to run this project in development mode.

### 1. Generate a Self-Signed Root Certificate

Create the directories you will save the the certificates in:

```bash
  $ mkdir ./client/certificates/ && mkdir ./client/certificates/server && mkdir ./client/certificates/root && cd ./client/certificates.
```

Generate an rsa private key for the root certificate:

```bash
$ openssl genrsa -out root/key.pem 2048
```

Generate the self-signed root certificate using the private key:

```bash
$ openssl req -x509 -new -nodes -key root/key.pem -sha256 -days 365 -out root/crt.pem
```

### 2. Create a Server Certificate

Generate a private key for the server:

```bash
$ openssl genrsa -out server/key.pem 2048
```

Generate a certificate signing request (CSR) using the serverâ€™s private key:

```bash
$ openssl req -new -key server/key.pem -out server/csr.pem
```

Sign the CSR with the root certificate to create the server certificate:

```bash
$ openssl x509 -req -in server/csr.pem -CA root/crt.pem -CAkey root/key.pem -CAcreateserial -out server/crt.pem -days 365 -sha256
```

### Run the development server

```bash
$ cd .. && sudo docker compose up
```
